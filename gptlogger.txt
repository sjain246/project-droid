Starting GPT log for task with title: Fix price filtersGenerated Description: 
As an engineer, the task at hand is to fix the price filters on our e-commerce platform. Currently, there seems to be an issue with the functionality that allows users to filter products based on price range. Upon investigation, it has been observed that the price filters are not accurately displaying the appropriate products within the specified price range. This inconsistency is leading to a frustrating user experience, as the users are not able to effectively narrow down their search based on price. It is crucial that we address this issue promptly to ensure a seamless and efficient browsing experience for our customers.Generated Acceptance: 
Acceptance Criteria:
1. The price filter should accurately display products within the specified price range.
2. The filter should be responsive and update in real-time as the user adjusts the price range.
3. The filter should be able to handle both minimum and maximum price values.
4. The filter should not affect the display of other filtering options or disrupt the overall functionality of the website.
5. The updated price filter should be thoroughly tested and verified to ensure it is functioning as expected.Generated Assumptions: 
As an engineer, I would assume the following:

1. End user behavior: The end user understands how price filters work and expects them to function accurately. They will input the desired price range and expect the displayed results to match their criteria.

2. Environment: The system is being used in a stable and functioning environment, such as a web or mobile application, where the user can interact with the price filter feature.

3. Provided data format: The price data is provided in a consistent and standardized format, such as numeric values or a specific currency format. Any conversion or formatting required will be handled by the system.

These assumptions will help ensure that the engineer can focus on addressing the specific issue with the price filter feature effectively.Generated Labels:

Title: Bug - Price Filters not Working Properly

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the product search page.
2. Apply price filters to narrow down the search results.
3. Verify that the products displayed are within the specified price range.
4. Change the price filters to a different range.
5. Observe if the displayed products update accordingly.

Environment Details:
- Operating System: Windows 10
- Browser: Google Chrome (Version X.X.X)

Description:
The price filters on the product search page are not functioning correctly. When applying a specific price range, the search results do not update accordingly, displaying products outside the specified range. This inconsistency makes it challenging for users to find products within their desired price range.

Expected Behavior:
When a price range is applied, the search results should update dynamically to only display products falling within that specific range. This ensures accurate filtering and enhances the user experience.

Actual Behavior:
The search results do not reflect the applied price filters accurately. Products outside the specified price range continue to be displayed, causing confusion and inconvenience for users.

Note: This bug seems to affect both the web and mobile versions of the platform.Starting GPT log for task with title: Fix price filtersGenerated Description: 
As an engineer, I have identified an issue with the price filters in our system. Currently, when users apply price filters to search for products within a specific price range, the filters do not function accurately. This is causing user frustration as they are unable to effectively narrow down their search results based on price.

This improvement will greatly enhance the user experience and increase customer satisfaction.Generated Acceptance: 
The acceptance criteria for fixing price filters are as follows:

1. The price filter should accurately display the available price ranges based on the products in the system.
2. When a price range is selected, the filter should only display products within that price range and hide products outside of the selected range.
3. The price filter should update in real-time as the user adjusts the range, without requiring a page reload.
4. The price filter should be responsive and compatible with different screen sizes and devices.
5. The fix should be tested and verified to ensure that it resolves any existing issues with the price filters and does not introduce any new bugs.Generated Assumptions: 
Assumptions for the task "Fix price filters":
